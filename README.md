# cheQuadX

Source code for firmware of quadcopter. Written in C/C++ (arduino).
--------------
In feb 2015, I took this fun project i.e. to implement a quadCopter for learning purpose.
I have not finished the development <span style="color:red;">yet</span>, but it is up in my TODO list.

I also added the project on [Hack A day](https://hackaday.io/project/6266-chequadx "Link") (more info is available there).
